# Aetherium – Mixed Reality EchoBoard Prototype

Welcome! This repository presents **Aetherium**, a feature concept designed for enhancing AR user experiences through **spatial, time-based Echoes**. This was developed as part of a Product Management Intern assignment.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Aetherium** transforms passive AR into a contextual, interactive, and collaborative mixed-reality workspace by allowing users to:

- Drop time-sensitive, location-aware Echoes (e.g., “Meeting @ 9 AM”)
- Filter, organize, and act on reminders via a live **EchoBoard**
- Enable team sharing, expiration logic, and recurring alerts
