# Aetherium – Mixed Reality EchoBoard Prototype

Welcome! This repository presents **Aetherium**, a feature concept designed for enhancing AR user experiences through **spatial, time-based Echoes**. This was developed as part of a Product Management Intern assignment.

---

## 🧠 Overview

**Aetherium** transforms passive AR into a contextual, interactive, and collaborative mixed-reality workspace by allowing users to:

- Drop time-sensitive, location-aware Echoes (e.g., “Meeting @ 9 AM”)
- Filter, organize, and act on reminders via a live **EchoBoard**
- Enable team sharing, expiration logic, and recurring alerts

## 🧭 Walkthrough – How to Use the EchoBoard

### 🏠 1️⃣ Home / Camera View
Upon loading, you enter the **main EchoBoard interface** — simulating a live AR camera.

**You’ll see two primary controls:**
- 📍 **My Echoes** – Opens a scrollable list of saved Echoes.
- ➕ **Drop Echo** – Opens the Echo creation modal.

---

### ➕ 2️⃣ Create a New Echo
Click **Drop Echo** and:
- ✍️ Type your Echo message (e.g., “Meeting at 10 AM”).
- ✅ Click **Save** to pin the Echo to your EchoBoard.

---

### 📄 3️⃣ View & Manage Your Echoes
Click **My Echoes** to see all your current Echoes.

Each Echo card includes:
- 🎨 **Color-coded category** tag (Meeting, Reminder, Task, etc.)
- 🧾 Echo note text
- ⏰ Countdown timer until expiry
- ✅ **Mark as Done** – completes and hides the Echo
- 🗑 **Delete** – removes the Echo immediately

---

### 👥 4️⃣ Shared Echoes
Echoes marked as **“Shared”** are visible to all team members.
Useful for group reminders, events, or shared task coordination.

---

### 🎨 5️⃣ Color Tags
Echoes are labeled with default categories like:
- 🟦 Meeting
- 🟩 Reminder
- 🟧 Task
- 🟥 Urgent
- 🟪 Shared

These improve clarity and are foundational for future filtering/sorting.
